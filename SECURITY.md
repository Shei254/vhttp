## Report a security issue

The vhttp project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via vhttp-vuln@googlegroups.com.

## Security advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team endeavors to coordinate remediation with third-party stakeholders, and is committed to transparency in the disclosure process. The vhttp team announces security issues via [Github Release notes](https://github.com/vhttp/vhttp/releases) as well as [the vhttp website](vhttp.examp1e.net) on a best-effort basis.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Once the report has been acknowledged by the vhttp maintainer team, the timeline window to public disclosure will start.

* Timeline window to public disclosure is 90 days long.
* The vhttp maintainer team will remediate the vulnerability before the 90 day window closes.
* There will be a 14-day grace period AFTER the 90 day window, in which the vhttp maintainer team can negotiate to make the report publicly available.

   Example: The 90 day due date falls on a holiday for the vhttp maintainers. The vhttp maintainers can negotiate with the reporter to move the disclosure to 4 days after the 90 day due date.

* The exact time (in UTC) and date of public disclosure will be agreed upon by the vhttp maintainers and the reporter.
